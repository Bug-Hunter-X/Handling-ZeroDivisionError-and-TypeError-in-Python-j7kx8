This repository contains a Python example showcasing an uncommon error scenario. The code demonstrates handling both ZeroDivisionError and TypeError exceptions within a single function. This is a common issue, but its combined handling in a single function might be less familiar to beginners. The solution file provides an improved structure for error handling and input validation.
